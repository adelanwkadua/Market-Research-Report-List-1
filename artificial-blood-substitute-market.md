<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Blood Substitute Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Perfluorocarbon-based Oxygen Carrier (PFBOC)</li><li>Hemoglobin-based Oxygen Carrier (HBOC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial blood substitute market primarily consists of two types: perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers (PFBOCs) and hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs). PFBOCs utilize fluorinated compounds to dissolve and transport oxygen, enhancing tissue oxygenation without the complications associated with blood transfusions. HBOCs are derived from hemoglobin and aim to mimic the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells. Both types show potential in addressing blood shortages and improving surgical outcomes, though they face regulatory challenges and ongoing research for efficacy and safety.</p></p>
