<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cells Cryopreservation Equipments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stem cells cryopreservation equipment market consists of two primary types: liquid phase and vapor phase. Liquid phase cryopreservation involves storing stem cells in liquid nitrogen at extremely low temperatures, ensuring long-term viability. This method typically allows for direct immersion of samples in the liquid nitrogen. Conversely, vapor phase cryopreservation uses the gaseous area above the liquid nitrogen, providing a slightly higher temperature that can be beneficial for certain applications while still maintaining sample integrity. Both methods are essential for effective stem cell preservation.</p></p>
