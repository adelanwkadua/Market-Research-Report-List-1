<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Powerboat Insurance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Actual Cash Value</li><li>Agreed Amount Value</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Powerboat insurance features two primary market types: Actual Cash Value (ACV) and Agreed Amount Value (AAV). ACV policies compensate for the boat's current market value at the time of loss, accounting for depreciation.
