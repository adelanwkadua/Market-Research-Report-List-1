<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Creatinine Measurement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Jaffe's Kinetic Method</li><li>Enzymatic Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The creatinine measurement market primarily consists of two key types: Jaffe's Kinetic Method and the Enzymatic Method. The Jaffe's method involves a colorimetric reaction with creatinine and picric acid, resulting in a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically. This method is cost-effective and widely used but may produce interferences. The Enzymatic Method, on the other hand, utilizes specific enzymes to convert creatinine into measurable products, offering higher accuracy and fewer interferences, but typically at a higher cost.</p></p>
